# Launchpad
A utility that allows the Ableton / Novation Launchpad Mini to be used as a macro keypad similar to an Elgato Stream Deck.

Features include:
- Set any button to red, green, or orange
- The program closes / minimizes to the system tray to stay running in the background
- Make any button play a sound, run a program, change a scene in OBS, or type anything into any program (like macros or key bindings)
- Button settings are automatically saved
- Save different sets of button setups to a file that can be loaded later
- Reset all your buttons back to blank / default

Upcoming features:
- Communicate with OBS to start / pause recording and streaming
- Set any button to play any MIDI sound

A note about compatibility:
I only have a Launchpad Mini to test with, so that's the only supported device at this time. If you would like to add support for your particular device (like a full-size Launchpad), please feel free to submit a pull-request.
